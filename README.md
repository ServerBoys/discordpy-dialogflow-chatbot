<h1 align=center><strong>Discordpy Dialogflow Chatbot Examples</strong></h1>
<h3 align=center>An open source repo just to help anyone who may want to use this tool in the future.</h3>
<br />
<h2> Why would you want to use this? </h2>
<p> You can use dialogflow to make chatbots, or if that's too complicated, you can use it's machine learning
  to make your bot understand what a user is asking for when it's mentioned. <em> For example, "@MyBot can u hElp?"
  could trigger a help command, and dialogflow uses Google's ML to understand what users want and make life easier.</em></p>
<br />
<h2> Ok, how do I get started? </h2>
<p> You'll need to install the module apiai. Currently this is what I use for the repo. I'm not sure if this
  works with dialogflowv2 agents, so it's best to set yours to dialogflowv1. To install, simply do:
  <strong><em>pip install apiai</em></strong>
  Then make sure to <em>import apiai</em></p>
<br />
<h2> Your code sucks, can I please make it better? </h2>
<p> Sure you can, just open a pull request and I'll be glad to merge it :) </p>
