# Discord.py Dialogflow Chatbot Examples
### An open source repo just to help anyone who may want to use this tool in the future. Supporting async, ext and rewrite


## Why would you want to use this?
You can use dialogflow to make chatbots, or if that's too complicated, you can use it's machine learning
to make your bot understand what a user is asking for when it's mentioned. *For example, "@MyBot can u hElp?"*
could trigger a help command, and dialogflow uses Google's ML to understand what users want and make life easier.


## Ok, how do I get started? 
You'll need to install the module apiai. Currently this is what I use for the repo. I'm not sure if this
works with dialogflowv2 agents, and I'm 80% sure it doesn't, so it's best to set yours to dialogflowv1. To install, simply do: 

  
```bash
pip3 install apiai
```

Then make sure to <em>import apiai</em>

## Your code sucks, can I please make it better?
Sure you can, just open a pull request and I'll be glad to merge it :)
